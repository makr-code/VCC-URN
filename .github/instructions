Project: VCC-URN (URN Management System)
Language: Python

Purpose:
- Manage Uniform Resource Names and resolution services for VCC assets.

What Copilot should help with:
- Implement registration, resolution and lookup APIs; support namespace management.
- Create validation, normalization and conflict-resolution logic.

Coding style and constraints:
- Maintain strict validation rules for identifiers; document namespace rules in `docs/`.

Documentation duties (./docs):
- `docs/URN-spec.md` must describe identifier format, namespaces, and resolution algorithm.

Todo.md continuation:
- Add onboarding tasks for new namespaces, including ownership and sample data.

Examples for Copilot prompts:
- "Add an endpoint to register a URN with owner metadata and TTL."

Testing & CI:
- Add tests for resolution edge cases and collision handling.
